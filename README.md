Codecademy Pro Learn Python Final Project Markov Chain Text Generator 28 October 2018

This is my Codecacademy Pro Learn Python Final Project Markov Chain Text Generator. I am new to programming and this is my first project so it is written in a very 'newbie' style. It is written using Python 2.7.15.

Its concept is to generate random text using Markov Chain Text Generator from some links of some books founded online.
